The University Course Timetabling Problem (UCTP) is a scheduling problem in which a set of events
(lectures, labs) are to be assigned locations (lecture halls, computer rooms) and time slots (time and date)
while satisfying a number of constraints such as avoiding double-booking of locations, ensuring that
events are assigned to locations equipped with suitable features (projectors, fume hoods) and minimizing
the number of events overlapping in time that have the same participants (lecturers, student groups).

\red{There are many variants of UCTP ...}

More formally, \red{most real-world applicable variants of?} UCTP is an NP-hard\parencite{lovelace} combinatorial optimization problem, meaning the % TODO: reformulate, UCTP is a combinatorial optimization problem that is NP-hard in most nontrivial instances (or something similar)
search for optimal solutions to non-trivial problem instances is currently thought to be generally
intractable, turning the attention to methods of approximation. Many methods of approximation fall
under the umbrella term of metaheuristics\parencite{lewis}, which is a collection of algorithmic ideas
often inspired by natural processes. Examples of metaheuristics include evolutionary algorithms,
simulated annealing and ant colony optimization. The current state of the art lies in hybrid
metaheuristics where a population-based method is combined with some form of local
search\parencite{ilyas-iqbal}.
